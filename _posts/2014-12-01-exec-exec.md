EXEC Submits a command to the server and waits for the result.

 Usage: pgResult=pgmex('exec',dbConn,command)

 INPUT:
   regular:
     dbConn: uint32 or uint64 [1,1] - C pointer to a PGconn structure
     command: char [1,N] - SQL command to be executed
 OUTPUT:
   optional:
     pgResult: uint32 or uint64 [1,1] - C pointer to a PGresult structure

 Notes:
   1) The command can contain only a single SQL statement (nested
     function calls or complex SELECT statements are admissible).
   2) Server errors (e.g. due to malformed SQL) will trigger exceptions.
   3) If no output is requested, the result will be disposed of
     automatically. Otherwise, the result needs to be cleared using the
     CLEAR command to avoid memory leaks (even if no tuples were
     returned.)
